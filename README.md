# GitHub Slides
This is a static site that can display slides using
[revealjs](https://revealjs.com/) and its Markdown feature.
Provide the path/branch of the Markdown file as the "path" URL
parameter and this will render it. This README is a live
example:

# Basic Syntax
  ```markdown
  # Section 1.0: New vertical slides
  Vertical slides (subsections) are separated by a horizontal
  rule on its own line (i.e. `^***\n`).
  ***
  # Section 1.1
  This slide would appear below the first one. Two horizontal rules back to back
  will separate sections, and cause a new slide on the right.
  ***
  ***
  # Section 2
  This would appear on the right, i.e. second column, first row.
  ```
