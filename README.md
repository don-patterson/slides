# GitHub Slides
This is a static site that can display slides using
[revealjs](https://revealjs.com/) and its Markdown feature.
Provide the path/branch of the Markdown file as the "path" URL
parameter and this will render it. This README is a live
example:

https://don-patterson.github.io/slides?path=don-patterson/slides/gh-pages/README.md

***

To start a new vertical slide use a horizontal rule `***` on its own line,
and to start a new horizontal slide use two horizontal rules. i.e.

  ```md
  # Slide
  section 1.1

  ***

  # New slide below
  section 1.2

  ***
  ***

  # New slide to the right
  section 2.1
  ```
<!-- .element class="r-stretch" -->

***
