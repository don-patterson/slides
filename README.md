# GitHub Slides
This is a static site that can display slides using
[revealjs](https://revealjs.com/) and its Markdown feature.
Provide the path to your Markdown file as the URL parameter
"markdown" and this will render it. This README is a live
example: https://don-patterson.github.io/slides?markdown=./README.md

***

Slides are separated vertically by the Markdown horizontal
line `***` and slides are separated horizontally by a double
horizontal line (two `***` lines).

Enjoy! Issues, PRs, comments all welcome on [GitHub](https://github.com/don-patterson/slides/)!
